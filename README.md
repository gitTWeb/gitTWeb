## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a programmer who knows C++ and is working to expand my knowledge of technology overall. Here I will share my projects and experiments as I grow my skills!

Im currently working on:

Number converter(https://github.com/gitTWeb/Arabic-number-to-Roman-Numerals)
- A program that converts Arabic Numbers to Roman numerals using strings and arrays.

String comparison(https://github.com/gitTWeb/String-Comparison)
- A program that compares two user input strings by converting them to lower case and then seeing which is larger or if they are equal to each other.

**Tools:** C++
